# SearchingAlgo-Visualizer
Searching algorithms included in this visualizer are:

1.Linear Search: 
Element is searched in a sequential manner.

2.Binary Search: 
In this the sorted array is divided into two parts and the elementis searched in either of the part based on the condition.

3.Ternary Search: 
It is a conquer algorithm that is used for searching an element in an array. It is similar to Binary search where we can divide the array into two parts but in this, we divide the array into three parts and search the element.
